# Our project
The aim of this part is to improve the idea of lecturing at schools. This is a very broad topic, so in our project, we are focusing on one particular, but very important problem:
how to ensure constant or inccreasing lecture quality while employing more and more lecturers?

Finding good lecturers is difficult, but it's even more difficult to provide lectures of the same high quality while having more lecturers giving presentations about the same topic! 
Schools who apply for lectures are going to expect at least as good lectures as the previous ones, a lecture of poor quality could discourage them from taking part in the project.

# The quality of a lecture
The quality of the lecture mainly depens on two factors: the presenting style of the lecturer, and quality content.

The presenting style of the lecturer includes:
- maintaining the interest of the audience
- speaking understandably, coherently, thoughtfuly and at the pace which fits the audience the most
- not shifting the topic, yet including interesting examples and personal experiences
- not going too much into foggy details, yet providing enough information while staying possible to follow
- colorful, eye-catching presentation with many pictures, videos, and necessary amount of text

Quality content means:
- providing enough information about the topic
- up-to-date, real-life based information
- interesting examples to illustrate topics
- pictures, videos, chart, graphs which help to understand the presentation better

In order to keep up the quality, all lecturers have to apply these criteria and follow these guidelines.
In our project, we came up ideas to help lecturers in both fields.

# Presenting style
As listed above, many presenting skills are required from all lecturers. To help them obtaining these, we have created a list of guidelines which have to kept by all lecturers. When Hack Slovakia employes a new lecturer, he/she should be told to apply these guidelines to hold quality lectures. 
Furthermore, Hack Kosice could provide presentation templates for each topic. The template should include a draft about the presentation and standardized design. Lecturers could use this presentation template to prepare for their lectures, this way, lectures could keep up the quality and all lectures could be similar yet diverse, ensuring quality.

# Quality content
As for the quality of the content, we came up with the idea to create a webpage for the lecturers where they can share their experiences, class materials and feedback from students.
Every topic could have a distinct part on the webpage where lecturers can upload their presentations, they can share their experiences and ideas how the certain topic could be taught better and everyone could see the feedback of the students about the certain topics. The best student projects, in-class experiences and tasks and picture/video materials would also be available for the lecturers. 

On the webpage, at each topic folder, these materials  would be available for the lecturers:
- student feedbacks about the previous lectures
- presentations of previous lectures
- best videos, images, and further materials which illustrate the topic
- the experiences of the lecturers who teach the certain topics
- in-class project ideas, homework ideas
- further 

If lecturers are preparing for their lectures, they could see all the materials, feedbacks and experiences of previous lectures well organized on a webpage. This way, they could learn from each others experiences and the best ideas would be reused, resulting in improved and more constant overall quality. Instead of "reinventing the wheel" each time, this way, lecturers could focus on the further development of the topic, instead of having to create presenations from scratch each time.

# Lecturer mentors
Beside these ideas, we would also advice Hack Slovakia to employ some mentors, who could pay atention to lecturers (especially for the new ones). Mentors could help lecturers to apply the presentation guidelines, give ideas, tricks and tips to make presentaions better, and they could monitor the lectures to see whether the quality is staying high enough, or whether it's improving or decreasing. They could help the lecturers to find they strengths and weeknesses, and based on them they could give advices, how to improve the quality of the presentation.

These mentors could be even elder, or more experienced members of the team, who have experience both in creating a presentation (collecting materials, making slides, ect..) and holding the real-life lecture. This program would be a great opportunity for new lecturers, becouse it provides them the feeling of belonging to the team, but it's also a great opportunity for the others, becouse the mentors see the lectures from an another point of view, so they can give advices to the lecturer how to improve the qality of their presentation.
# Summary
To maintain constant or improving quality, we offer three main ideas. Presentation templates and guidelines could help lecturers to ensure high quality presenting style. A webpage for sharing experiences and materials about certain topics could improve lectures and help the best ideas to spread. Lecturer mentors would enable lecturers to get help by preparing for their lectures and mentors would monitor the whole project to see what's right and  what's wrong.
