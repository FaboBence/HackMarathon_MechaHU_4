# Our project
The aim of this part is to improve the idea of lecturing at schools. This is a very broad topic, so in our project, we are focusing on one particular, but very important problem:
how to ensure constant or inccreasing lecture quality while employing more and more lecturers?

Finding good lecturers is difficult, but it's even more difficult to provide lectures of the same high quality while having more lecturers giving presentations about the same topic! 
Schools who apply for lectures are going to expect at least as good lectures as the previous ones, a lecture of poor quality could discourage them from taking part in the project.

# The quality of a lecture
The quality of the lecture mainly depens on two factors: the presenting style of the lecturer, and quality content.

The presenting style of the lecturer includes:
- maintaining the interest of the audience
- speaking understandably, coherently, thoughtfuly and at the pace which fits the audience the most
- not shifting the topic, yet including interesting examples and personal experiences
- not going too much into foggy details, yet providing enough information while staying possible to follow
- colorful, eye-catching presentation with many pictures, videos, and necessary amount of text

Quality content means:
- providing enough information about the topic
- up-to-date, real-life based information
- interesting examples to illustrate topics
- pictures, videos, chart, graphs which help to understand the presentation better

In order to keep up the quality, all lecturers have to apply these criteria and follow these guidelines.
In our project, we came up ideas to help lecturers in both fields.

# Presenting style
As listed above, many presenting skills are required from all lecturers. To help them obtaining these, we have created a list of guidelines which have to kept by all lecturers. When Hack Slovakia employes a new lecturer, he/she should be told to apply these guidelines to hold quality lectures. 
Furthermore, Hack Kosice could provide presentation templates for each topic. The template should include a draft about the presentation and standardized design. Lecturers could use this presentation template to prepare for their lectures, this way, lectures could keep up the quality and all lectures could be similar yet diverse, ensuring quality.

# Quality content
As for the quality of the content, we came up with the idea to create a webpage for the lecturers where they can share their experiences, class materials and feedback from students.
Every topic could have a distinct part on the webpage where lecturers can upload their presentations, they can share their experiences and ideas how the certain topic could be taught better and everyone could see the feedback of the students about the certain topics. The best student projects, in-class experiences and tasks and picture/video materials would also be available for the lecturers. Once a lecturer is preparing for a presentation, they could see all the materials, feedbacks and experiences of previous lectures on the same topic. This idea could help to learn from each others experiences and to reuse the best ideas, resulting in improvind and more constant overall quality.

# Lecturer mentors
Beside these ideas, we would also advice Hack Slovakia to employ some mentors who could help the lecturers to prepare themselves for the lectures. Mentors could help lecturers to apply the presentation guidelines, give ideas, tricks and tips to make presentaions better, and they could monitor the lectures to see whether the quality is staying high enough, or whether it's improving or decreasing. 

# Summary
To maintain constant or improving quality, we offer three main ideas. Presentation templates and guidelines could help lecturers to ensure high quality presenting style. A webpage for sharing experiences and materials about certain topics could improve lectures and help the best ideas to spread. Lecturer mentors would enable lecturers to get help by preparing for their lectures and mentors would monitor the whole project to see what's right and  what's wrong.
